# Introduction
There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isn’t compacted properly as well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not eing identified quickly and left untreated. This project to perform image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks. This model will be impactful and may save thousands of lives.
